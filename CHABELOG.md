# Changelog

All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

## [6.2.4] - 2025-11-12

### âœ¨ Added
- Form Request regeneration now converts `unique:` pipe rules into `Rule::unique()->ignore()` instances so update flows respect the current model.

### ðŸ”§ Changed
- Normalised the generated validation arrays to keep `Rule` objects intact alongside classic pipe strings.
- Resource responses continue to funnel boolean and datetime fields through `StatusHelper` formatting helpers for consistent API payloads.

### ðŸ›  Fixed
- Route-model bound updates no longer fail unique validation when editing existing records thanks to the new ignore logic.

## [6.1.0] - 2025-09-18

### âœ¨ Added
- Resource generator inspects migration metadata and runtime relations to wire nested resources automatically.
- Inline `--fields` metadata now powers fillable arrays, casts, validation rules, and relation hints across DTOs, resources, and tests.

### ðŸ”§ Changed
- Schema parser improvements provide consistent type normalisation for rule building and casting.

## [6.0.0] - 2025-07-01

### âœ¨ Added
- Migration parsing captures nullable, unique, enum, and foreign-key hints to drive validation and relation metadata.
- CLI received granular opt-in/out switches plus inline schema parsing for generators.

### ðŸ”§ Changed
- Improved fallbacks when the target Eloquent model does not exist yet by inferring table names and schema from migrations.

## [4.0.0] - 2025-06-04

### âœ¨ Added
- `FormRequestGenerator`: generates Store/Update requests with auto validation rules based on migrations and model fields.
- `ControllerGenerator`: generates full RESTful API controllers with service injection, resource usage, and request validation.
- `ResourceGenerator`: generates JsonResource with auto-detected fields, boolean formatting, date formatting, and eager loaded relations.
- `StatusHelper`: added as default helper for standardized success/error API responses and data formatting.
- Built-in Jalali date helper (`Goli` class and `goli()` helper) replacing the external dependency, with Persian digit formatting support, Jalali string parsing, and conversion helpers available application-wide.

- Auto-discovery of model relations (`BelongsTo`, `HasOne`, etc.) for eager loading in `show` and `update` methods.
- `MigrationFieldParser` support with a new `--from-migration` CLI flag to derive fillable fields, casts, validation rules, and test payloads directly from migration files when the model class is missing.

### ðŸ”§ Changed
- New simplified CLI flags:
  - `--controller=Admin` instead of `--with-controller`
  - `--requests` instead of `--with-form-requests`
- Controller path and namespace auto-adjusted with subfolder support.
- Status helper date normalisation now accepts Carbon instances, Jalali strings, and timestamps directly.
- Automatically generates and uses correct FormRequest and Resource class names.

### ðŸ›  Fixed
- Fixed `use` statement path resolution to prevent invalid slashes.
- Fixed wrong injection of model in load statements (`$this->model` â†’ `$model`).
- Fixed namespacing in published files.
